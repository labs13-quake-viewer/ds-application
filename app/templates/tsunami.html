    <p>Moving the mouse over the graph will provide you more specific information.</p> 
    <p>The charts here show the average damage for each category listed. The chart on the left shows damage from earthquakes that generated a tsunami. The numbers shown here include the damage caused by the tsunami. The right chart shows damage caused by an earthquake that didn't have an associated tsunami. The numbers are damage caused strictly by an earthquake at the given magnitude.</p>
    <p>The graphs here give us some idea of the relationship between the damage caused by an earthquake that generates a tsunami, and one that doesn't. We can see only so much in the graphs. So, in addition to the graphs, below are some t-tests and p-values for each of the categories in the graphs above.</p>
